# Royal Paws

Royal Paws is a small, Reigns-like game where you play as the ruler of a Cat Kingdom.

Every decision you make will affect one or more of the pillars of your kingdom - your authority, wealth, army, and the support of the common paws.

Navigate the delicate balance of leadership by responding to the dilemmas and demands of your subjects. Your choices will shape the fate of the realm and determine whether your reign will be remembered as glorious - or CATastrophic.

Built with **Unity 6**.

## Notes

This project was created for the Crazy Web Game Jam 2024.

Please note that, due to the tight time constraints of the jam, most of the code is not well-commented and isn't as polished as it could be. That said, I tried to keep it as clean as possible. There's still plenty of room for improvement.

For the most part, I'm using singleton managers to control the game states and properties.

## Card content

You will find the existing content under ```Assets/_CSV```. There is an Editor Script in place for importing/updating cards via a context menu.
