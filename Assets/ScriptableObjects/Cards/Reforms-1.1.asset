  Description: Meowjesty, I come not as a rebel, but as a humble servant of truth.
    The kingdom's ways have grown heavy upon the common paws, their cries unheard,
    their purrs unmet. I speak for justice and mercy, for fairness to all who dwell
    beneath your rule. Change is needed, not to break the realm, but to mend it.
    Hear my plea, Meowjesty, for the good of all catkind.
